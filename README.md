## Description
The website, blog, and portfolio for Ryan R. Campbell.

### History
I started blogging in the early 2010s on Blogger before moving to WordPress in 2015. Since that time, I've become a web developer in my own right and, as such, it felt only fitting to finally build out the digital footprint for my personal and professional endeavors from scratch.

For more on my journey to becoming a web developer—as well as what went into creating a backwards-compatible site experience that hosts WordPress-era content—be sure to visit the site's [about page](https://www.ryanrcampbell.com/about) and keep an eye on the [blog](https://www.ryanrcampbell.com/blog).
