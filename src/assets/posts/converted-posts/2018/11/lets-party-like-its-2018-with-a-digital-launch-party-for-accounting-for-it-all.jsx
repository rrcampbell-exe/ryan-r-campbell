    <p><em><a href="http://accountingforitall.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accounting for It All</a></em>‘s book birthday is tomorrow! To celebrate, join me on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell">@iamrrcampbell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AccountingForItAll&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#AccountingForItAll</a> on <strong>Monday, November 19th</strong> for a day filled with <em>Accounting for It All </em>facts, fanfare, and other fun.</p>
<p>We'll officially kick off the celebration at 8 a.m. ET with a “one like, one fact” thread, where for every like the designated tweet receives, I'll share another fact about <em>Accounting for It All </em>or the research that went into it.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of the day, I'll also tweet links to AFIA sneak peeks, never-before-seen <em>Accounting for It All </em>art by Maggie Derrick, and other AFIA-related content.</p>
<p>Can't make it to the digital launch party? Perhaps <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2088195254548679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the in-person book launch on Saturday, December 1st</a> will work better for you.</p>
<p>If attending that event doesn't fit your schedule either, never fear: I'll still sign your paperback copy of <em>Accounting for It All </em>through my sign-by-mail program, which you can learn more about <a href="http://accountingforitall.com/signmybook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this address</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks as always for your readership and support. Read on and read well.</p>
