    <p>It's a book! It's with great pride that I welcome my very first book baby, <a href="http://accountingforitall.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Accounting for It</em> <em>All</em></a>, into the world. At 321 pages long and weighing in at 12.8 ounces (according to Amazon, anyway), I couldn't be more pleased to share Robin's story with you.</p>
<p>Baby metaphors aside, all of this means one thing: <em>Accounting for It All</em> is now officially available worldwide.</p>
<p>So how can you get your hands on a copy? The links below are a great place to start.</p>

<p>If you'd rather get a copy in person from your local bookstore, you can ask if they have it available! If they don't, they can order one (or ten) copies for you. They might ask for the book's ISBN to help them locate it, so I'll leave the print ISBN here for you (and them!): 978-1949909388.</p>
