    <p>Well, I only signed the contract a week ago, but that doesn't mean I'm not already busy working to get this book in your hands!</p>
<p>Here's a brief overview of the progress and projects so far.</p>
<h2>Revisions Have Begun!</h2>
<p>I'm planning to get my editor an updated copy of the manuscript by the end of January. I'm about ten of twenty-nine chapters into my revisions right now, so I'm definitely on target to make that deadline.</p>
<p>Then it'll be up to him to read and revert with suggestions for high-level revisions!</p>
<h2>Marketing Time</h2>
<p>Though NineStar Press will be doing plenty of publicity and marketing on my behalf, as authors we're also expected to hit the road and digital highways pretty hard to make sure our work gets out there.</p>
<p>Here are some things I have in the works that you can look forward to as we advance toward the publication date of November 26th!</p>
<ul>
<li>A podcumentary on the making of <em>Accounting For It All</em></li>
<li>Commissioned artwork to introduce you to the book's main characters</li>
<li>Interviews and featurettes on blogs in the writersphere</li>
<li>A book-release launch party and book signing!</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above is still likely months away, but there's work happening for all of this (and more!) in the background.</p>
<h2>Twitter Teasers</h2>
<p>I'll be posting (almost) daily teasers of the manuscript on Twitter from now until the book's release date (and beyond!). Keep up to date and get a sneak peek at my debut novel every day by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following me over on Twitter</a>.</p>
<h2>And that about accounts for it all.</h2>
<p>Jokes. Cool.</p>
<p>On a serious note, a huge thank you to everyone for your support since last week's announcement. I'm more excited than ever to share this story with the world.</p>
