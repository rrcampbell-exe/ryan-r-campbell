    <p>I am absolutely thrilled to announce that my novel, <em>Accounting For It All</em>, has been selected for publication by the incredible team at NineStar Press. Below, you'll find an abbreviated version of the book's premise, which I used when pitching the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~~</p>
<p>When porn-star-turned-accountant Robin Whethers becomes the target of an IRS investigation, she figures things can’t get any worse. She’s unwittingly been at the center of a vast money laundering scheme, and to top it off, she has no real accounting knowledge.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, the investigation is the least of her concerns: hanging over her is the impending death of her terminally ill mother from whom Robin is estranged. Then there's the woman Robin considers to be the love of her life: she's back in town, finally ready to try to make things work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~~</p>
<p>You can look forward to having a copy of <em>Accounting For It All</em> in your hands (and on your e-reader!) on <strong>November 19th, 2018.</strong></p>
