    <p>We're now only 103(!) days away from the release of <em>Accounting for it All</em>, and things are really beginning to heat up!</p>
<p>Here's what's new since we last checked in.</p>
<h2>New Posts on Thursdays at Pornucopia</h2>
<p>We've had four new posts on the <em>Accounting for it All</em> blog, Thursdays at Pornucopia (NSFW). In those posts, I addressed the questions below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thursdaysatpornucopia.com/2018/07/12/what-about-sex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What about sex?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thursdaysatpornucopia.com/2018/07/19/the-romance-erotica-spectrum-what-about-accounting-for-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Romance-Erotica Spectrum: what about <em>Accounting for it All</em>?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thursdaysatpornucopia.com/2018/07/26/whats-it-like-to-film-porn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What's it like to film porn?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thursdaysatpornucopia.com/2018/08/02/what-about-safe-sex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What about safe sex?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up next, I'll provide evidence to debunk the myth that work in pornography is prohibitive to professional development, so <a href="http://thursdaysatpornucopia.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep an eye on the blog tomorrow!</a></p>
<h2>Incoming: Editor Revisions</h2>
<p>Any minute now… <em>any minute</em>…</p>
<p>That's how soon I could be receiving notes from my editor on the manuscript we'll use as our basis for what will become the final book!</p>
<p>Once I've received his notes, there'll be rewrites and a number of back and forths before the manuscript is off to the copy editor, proofreader, and quality assurance teams in the lead up to the book's release.</p>
<p>It feels like it's been <em>ages</em> since I've worked on this book&#8212;it's technically been since January&#8212;so I'm looking forward to returning to it once my edit letter arrives</p>
<h2>Book Launch!</h2>
<p>Pizza? Check. Drinks? Check. Copies of <em>Accounting for it All </em>signed by the author himself? Double-check.</p>
<p>You'll have all of this and more to look forward to at the <em>Accounting for it All </em>launch party on December 1st in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, just outside Madison. Alongside the above-mentioned amenities, there'll be giveaways, a reading from the book itself, an author Q&amp;A, and the cover reveal for my sophomore novel, <em><a href="http://www.empathynovel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</a></em>.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep an eye out for more details about the launch party as they come in by <a href="https://rrcampbellwrites.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d5b261c0c9ed58a1907dfdc4e&amp;id=26327b8a65" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signing up for my author newsletter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liking my page on Facebook</a>, from which you'll receive an official invite to the launch party as we get closer to December.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
