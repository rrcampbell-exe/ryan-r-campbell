<p>We're another month closer to the break of a new day.</p>
<p>There's been a sizable increase in traction since our last monthly update, both here on the blog and on the pages of <a href="http://empathynovel.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the <em>EMPATHY </em>series</a> manuscripts themselves. What has that traction looked like specifically, you ask?</p>
<h2>Hot Topics</h2>
<p>Our most popular blog post in the last month was <a href="http://empathynovel.com/2018/07/17/empathy-and-the-truth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“EMPATHY and the Truth,”</a> in which I explored the role and importance of journalism in our world, as well as how that importance plays itself out in the EMPATHY universe through the indefatigable investigative journalist Meredith Maxwell.</p>
<p>We've also covered hacking in two posts, namely <a href="http://empathynovel.com/2018/07/31/hacktivism-irl-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Hacktivism IRL + Beyond”</a> and <a href="http://empathynovel.com/2018/08/07/hacking-and-hacktivism-speculative-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Hacking and Hacktivism: Speculative Applications.”</a> Throw in another well-received post like “Piracy, Privacy, and the Intersection Thereof,” and it's plain to see why the buzz about EMPATHY continues to become more fervent.</p>

<h2>Manuscript Juggling</h2>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://empathynovel.com/2018/07/26/update-empathy-book-one-imminent-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this post near the end of July</a>, I've now delivered my final, pre-edits manuscript for <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</em> to my editor! What does this mean? It means the manuscript now in his hands is the version he'll read to begin the formal editing process.</p>
<p>To date, the manuscript had been edited only by the author itself and a handful of trusted beta readers and critique partners. Though the input of every third-party editor was of immense benefit in helping the book begin to approach its final shape, the comments from my editor at NineStar will further that process all the more, and I'm excited to see what he has to say.</p>
<p>With <em>Imminent Dawn</em> handed off to my editor, I've returned to work on its sequel, <em>Mourning Dove</em>. Since our last update on <em>Mourning Dove</em>, the manuscript has gone from a word count of 94,255 to 111,232 (~404 pages), though as I settle in over the next few weeks to put the finishing touches on this evaluation draft, these numbers will certainly shift again.</p>
<p>What's an evaluation draft, you ask? It's the draft I have to provide to my editor so that he can officially decide whether to move forward with the book. Though <em>Mourning Dove</em> is scheduled for an April 2019 release, how it's received during its initial evaluation could impact that date, though I'm positive the draft I'll have in hand by the September deadline will be more than up to snuff; I'm really loving the direction the story has headed (even if the characters might not always agree).</p>
<p>All the while, I'm beginning to compile notes for the third book in the series as well, <em>EMPATHY: Event Horizon</em>! I anticipate <em>Event Horizon</em> will be the series' most dense and darkest installment, and I'm absolutely thrilled to have writing it to look forward to.</p>
<h2>Shout it from the Mountaintops</h2>
<p>I've also enlisted the help of Leslie Blaize at Blaize communications to promote the <em>EMPATHY</em> series. As we develop our pre- and post-launch publicity plan, I continue to grow even more excited at the prospect of having <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn </em>in readers' hands in January 2019.</p>
<p>If you'd like to learn more about Leslie, you can visit the Blaize Communications website at <a href="http://blaizecommunications.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blaizecommunications.com</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, July was an intense month in the world of EMPATHY, and I look forward to keeping up that intensity as we get nearer to <em>Imminent Dawn</em>‘s release.</p>
