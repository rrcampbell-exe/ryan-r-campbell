    <p>Last week, I was finally able to unveil the cover of my debut novel, <a href="http://accountingforitall.com/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Accounting for It All</em></a>! If you missed the post over on accountingforitall.com, here's the cover now!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="  wp-image-274 aligncenter" src="https://thursdaysatpornucopia.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/accountingforitall-f.jpg?resize=630%2C945" alt="AccountingForItAll-f" width="630" height="945" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You can now find the book on <a href="https://ninestarpress.com/product/accounting-for-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NineStar Press website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're an eBook reader, you'll also find a preorder link on that page. <strong>More information about the availability of the print copy will be available soon.</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to thank cover designer <a href="http://natashasnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Snow</a> for bringing this cover into the world.</p>
<p>We're now only three weeks from the release of the book! In the meantime, keep your eyes on this blog or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> feeds for more information.</p>
