<p>I'm thrilled to announce I've been invited to speak at the 2019 University of Wisconsin Writers' Institute. The 2019 installment marks the 30th anniversary of the event, which will be held from April 4th - 7th in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Conference Director Laurie Scheer, <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast033/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who appeared on episode 033 of the r. r. campbell writescast</a>, received more than 250 proposals from authors around the globe, from which only a few dozen have been selected for the 2019 event.</p>
<p>My proposals included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dreaded Sag: Facelift Your Scenes with the Five Core Components of Scene Structure</li>
<li>Podcasts as a Portal: Platform, Publicity, and Passive Learning</li>
<li>“Yes, and—” - Improvisation and the Page</li>
<li>“I don’t know what to do with my hands” - Touching Up Scene for Characterization and Backstory</li>
</ul>
<p>It's with much pride that I can confirm <strong>all four proposals were accepted for the 2019 conference. </strong>More information about which sessions I will lead on which days will become available over the course of the coming months. As those details become available, you'll be able to find them on this blog, <a href="http://eepurl.com/dhBxcv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my newsletter</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Facebook.</a></p>
<p>Stay tuned, and I hope to see you at the conference in April 2019!</p>
