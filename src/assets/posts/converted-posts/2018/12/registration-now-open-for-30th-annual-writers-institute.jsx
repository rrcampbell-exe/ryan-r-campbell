As an Institute attendee, you'll also have the chance to meet and network with others who share your passion for storytelling. There are also opportunities throughout the conference to schedule time to pitch your work to literary agents!</p>

<p>Writing is often a solitary venture, but it doesn't have to be. Some of my longest-standing friendships in the world of writing have come out of this conference, which has kept me coming back year after year.</p>
<p>Aside from that and everything mentioned above in the <strong>What's the Writers' Institute? </strong>section, the Institute is an extraordinary once-a-year opportunity to learn from others while sharing your own perspectives as a writer.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <strong><a href="https://uwwritersinstitute.wisc.edu/speakers/r-r-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this year's event I'll be leading four sessions</a></strong>, the details of which can be found at the links below.</p>
