    <p>This week I received my editor’s notes for <em><a href="https://empathynovel.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</a></em>, which has given me an opportunity to immerse myself in this particular installment of the story for the first time in months. Since the arrival of my editor’s input, I’ve been hard at work to implement her suggested changes, as well as a number of other details I need to stitch in to create greater connectivity between book one and its sequels.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have content edits completed by December 3rd, so I’m really hustling to meet that deadline before we proceed into the copyediting and proofreading stages prior to the book’s release on January 28th, 2019.</p>
<p>It’s all happening. We’re now only 57 days to release…</p>
