    <p>We're now only 46 days from the release of<em> </em><em><a href="http://empathynovel.com/books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imminent Dawn</a></em>, and beginning next week at <a href="http://www.empathynovel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">empathynovel.com</a>, you'll get to meet its four main characters face to face&#8212;so to speak.</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, December 17th, you'll be introduced to the epic EMPATHY sci-fi saga's art-school dropout protagonist, along with the ruthless tech magnate, the advancement-hungry administrative assistant, and the relentless investigative journalist who form the foundation of the first installment in the series.</p>
<p>So join me at empathynovel.com from December 17th and every day through December 21st, the date on which we'll get to see every perspective character side-by-side.</p>
