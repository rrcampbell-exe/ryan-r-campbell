    <p>Since formally launching my editing services, it's been my pleasure to help dozens of writers hone their craft and build their confidence. As my client list has expanded, so has my knowledge and insight into how to best help writers achieve their goals for their manuscripts.</p>
<p>These factors&#8212;coupled with a sharpening of my own approach to the page as a result of my own writerly journey&#8212;will mean an increase in the pricing of my editing services beginning in January 2019.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<p>Well, <strong>if you book with me on or before December 31st, 2018, you can get locked into 2018 pricing</strong> even if your query, pages, or manuscript aren't ready for assessment until the new year. Oh, and <strong>if you're a previous client of mine, you'll remain eligible for 2018 pricing throughout 2019</strong>, regardless of when you book.</p>
<p>What will this increase in pricing look like?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/querycritiques/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Query and First Five Pages Critiques</a> </strong>will increase from $40 to $50.*</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/fiftyforfifty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fifty for Fifty</a> </strong>service will become the <strong>Fifty for Sixty </strong>service.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/developmentaledit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developmental Edits</a> </strong>will increase in pricing from $0.005/word to $0.007/word.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/personalwritingcoach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personal Writing Coach</a> </strong>services will increase from $0.011/word to $0.012/word.</li>
</ul>
<h6>*In 2019, this service will become eligible for <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/editingdiscounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my standard discounts</a>, which will remain in place throughout the year.</h6>
