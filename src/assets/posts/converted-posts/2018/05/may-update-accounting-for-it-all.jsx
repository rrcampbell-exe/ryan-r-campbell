    <p>Unless you're a newsletter subscriber, it's been a couple of months since I passed along updates on how things are going as we inch closer to the publication date of <em>Accounting for it All</em>.</p>
<p>Since my last post, we've had a number of things begin to fall into place. Check it out!</p>
<h2>Book Launch Party</h2>
<p>It's booked! And not just the book itself, I mean, but rather the book launch party.</p>
<p>The book launch party for <em>Accounting for it All</em> will be held at <strong>Atomic Koi</strong> <strong>Cocktail Bar </strong>in <strong>Fitchburg, Wisconsin</strong> on <strong>Saturday, December 1st</strong> from <strong>1:30 - 4 p.m.!</strong></p>
<p>What can you expect at the book launch party? Well, there'll be pizza, drinks, and books for sale and for signing! I'll also read a selection from <em>Accounting for it All</em>, and will make myself available for an author Q&amp;A during the event.</p>
<p>Who knows? There might even be a raffle or two. So stay tuned; we'll have even more details on this event next month!</p>
<h2>Book Blurb and Tagline</h2>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to ‚Äúfinalize‚Äù <em>Accounting for it All</em>‚Äòs book blurb and tagline. What are those, you ask? The blurb is what you'd find on the book's back cover (or in the book description on Amazon), and the tagline is a short, hopefully catchy or impactful promotional line for the book. After some back and forth with my editor, here's what we've landed on for now!</p>
<p><strong>Tagline: </strong>She's got the looks, but now it looks like she cooks the books.</p>
<p><strong>Book blurb: </strong>Former porn-star Robin Whethers has skated by as Pornucopia‚Äôs do-nothing accountant for years. And who can blame her? Her supervisor has only encouraged her dilly-dallying, and it‚Äôs given her oodles of time to do what she loves most: coach the talent at her mentor‚Äôs feminist-pornography studio.</p>
<p>But then the IRS comes knocking. With her supervisor unable to bail her out, Robin can either come clean and risk her friendships and career, or buck up and find another way to skirt the system. No matter how she chooses, she‚Äôll have to confront her blossoming feelings for the man she‚Äôs enlisted to teach her accounting and the return of the woman she‚Äôs always loved, who‚Äôs finally ready to try to make things work.</p>
<p>Both light-hearted and emotionally transformative, <em>Accounting for it All</em> is the tale of one woman‚Äôs quest for self-actualization that‚Äôs sure to please any reader who‚Äôs ever made the wrong choice for the right reasons.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The above may be tweaked here and there between now and November, but that's a taste of what you can expect once <em>Accounting for it All </em>is available!</p>
<h2>Cover Release</h2>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that <em>Accounting for it All</em>‚Äòs official cover will be available in late July! As we get nearer to the official release date, I'll be sure to plan an online event around the cover's debut.</p>
<p>To make sure you don't miss a thing, keep an eye on my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/iamrrcampbell">Instagram</a> feeds, where you can follow along for the most up-to-date information!</p>
<h2>New <em>AfiA </em>Blog</h2>
<p>April also marked the kick-off of a new blog on all things <em>Accounting for it All</em>! The new site, <a href="http://www.thursdaysatpornucopia.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThursdaysAtPornucopia.com</a>, focuses on the research that went into writing the book, and also explores topics relevant to it. As the name of the site might suggest, the blog homes in on subjects related to pornography, sex work, and the adult industry more generally.</p>
<p>This goes without saying, but it's probably NSFW, so when you do check it out, I recommend doing it outside of work. üôÇ</p>
<h2>That about accounts for it all.</h2>
<p>Over the next month, I'll be working to schedule media appearances in the lead-up to the book's release, and converging on what I'd like to suggest the book's final cover look like. The cover artist for NineStar Press always does great work, so I'm excited to see what she puts together once July rolls around!</p>
