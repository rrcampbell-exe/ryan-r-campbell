    <p>I am pleased to announce that I will have another novel published with NineStar Press: my sci-fi thriller, <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn. </em>It is the first installment of a planned series.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>On the outskirts of Austin, Texas near the capital of the conniving North American Union, rumors leak from the secretive research compound of the most powerful tech company in the world: news&#8212;both promising and devastating&#8212;of an internet-access brain implant transformative enough to change millions of lives&#8212;beginning with four lives, most specifically.</p>
<p>The investigative journalist who seeks the tech story of a lifetime, but must choose between her morals and her survival when her sleuthing runs afoul of the government’s designs.</p>
<p>The desperate art-school dropout, whose enrollment in the high-risk trial for the implant is a last ditch effort to apologize for her role in her wife’s coma.</p>
<p>The reclusive businessman, who would let his tech empire crumble if it meant he could bring his wife back from the dead.</p>
<p>And the advancement-hungry administrative assistant who ignores every warning… until it's too late to save herself, and possibly hundreds of patients on the research compound.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the course of <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</em>, the lives of these four strangers are set on a collision course that will leave them all floundering to reclaim that which they desire most: their loved ones, their freedom, their lives.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
