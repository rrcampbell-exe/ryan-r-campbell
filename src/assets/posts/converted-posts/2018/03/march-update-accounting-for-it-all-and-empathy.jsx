    <p>Whoa. Hey. What? Is that <em>two</em> books in this month's update? It sure is!</p>
<p>In case you missed <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/books/empathy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last Friday's announcement</a>, my sci-fi thriller, <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn </em>is to be published by NineStar Press in January 2019. It's the first installment in a planned series.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let's get some updates on what to expect in the world of <em>EMPATHY</em> before we examine the progress of <em>Accounting For It All</em>.</p>
<h1><em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</em></h1>
<h2>Outline Time</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned above, <em>Imminent Dawn</em> is the first in the planned <em>EMPATHY </em>series. When I say “planned,” I mean I know in broad brushstrokes what takes place over the course of the four sequels, but it hasn't been until the last few days that I've really thrown myself into developing a more concrete outline for <em>Imminent Dawn</em>‘s sequel, <em>Mourning Dove</em>.</p>
<p>I wrapped up a first-pass outline recently, but that, of course, is only an outline: I'll still have to write the thing, and I'm expecting the word count for that one to come in at a hefty 135,000 words, or about, uh, 490 pages.</p>
<p>That's all an informed estimate for now (and there's no guarantee the sequel will even get published… it'll still have to be decent in its own right), so let's stick with what we do know, which is where we're at with the first book in the series.</p>
<h2>“Final” Revisions</h2>
<p>I have a couple of months before my “final” revisions on <em>Imminent Dawn</em> are due to my editor, but I've already started compiling my notes for what those might look like, as I need to stitch in some precedent-establishing context for some things I know plan on weaving into the sequel.</p>
<p>Once those final edits are wrapped up (hopefully by mid-April), I'll fire them off to my editor so he can give me his own feedback before we really hit the revisions hard later this year!</p>
<p>That's more or less where we're at for the <em>EMPATHY </em>series for now, so let's take a peek at what's going on with <em>Accounting For It All</em>!</p>
<h1><em>Accounting For It All</em></h1>
<h2>Media Tour</h2>
<p>I'm beginning to put together a list of possible publications to target as part of a media tour in the lead up to the book's release. If you have a blog, podcast, or other connection to someone in the media who might be interested in running a story on <em>Accounting For It All</em>, <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let me know at this link!</a> I'd love to get in touch with them.</p>
<h2>Stickers!</h2>
<p>I recently ordered some awesome <em>Accounting For It All </em>stickers! Though I haven't received them yet, the final product will look like the below.</p>
