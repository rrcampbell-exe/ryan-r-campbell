    <p>The release date for <em>Accounting For It All</em> may still be months away, but that doesn't mean I'm not working on it in the background. Here's what I've been up to since the last update went out!</p>
<h2>First Revisions Submitted</h2>
<p>I submitted a new draft of the manuscript to my editor at NineStar Press on the 15th of January. From here, he'll give it a read and send me a list of proposed revisions, though probably not until this summer given our production timeline.</p>
<p>Aside from being reviewed by my editor, the manuscript will be provided to a sensitivity reader for their input. Since I'm writing a character of a different sexual orientation than my own, getting feedback from someone who has that in common with my main character will help ensure any possibly problematic or harmful representations can be addressed accordingly in future drafts.</p>
<p>Once I've received feedback from both the editor and the appointed sensitivity reader, I'll get to implementing their suggestions, and the manuscript will begin to look more and more like the final product you'll hold in your hands!</p>
<h2>Art Commissioned</h2>
<p>In the lead up to <em>Accounting For It All</em>â€˜s release, I'll be giving prospective readers an early introduction to the book's main character, Robin, and her primary love interest, Sarah.</p>
<p>To do so, I've commissioned a few pieces from the wonderfully talented Maggie Derrick, who'll help bring these characters to life. For a sample of her work, you can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaggieDerrick/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out her Patreon</a>, where you'll notice she's not only a visual artist, but an author as well!</p>
<p>For more from Maggie, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaggieDerrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can follow her on Twitter.</a></p>
<h2>Book Launch and Signing Details</h2>
<p>As part of the book's release, I plan to host a Madison-area book signing shortly after its debut. I'm currently scouting locations to host this event. To make sure you don't miss it as more details become available, be sure to <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscribe to my newsletter</a>, follow my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">author page on Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep and eye on my Twitter feed.</a></p>
<h2>Compiling Reviewers List</h2>
<p>As February advances, I'll also begin putting more serious work into compiling a list of book reviewers and bloggers who'll read and review <em>Accounting For It All</em> prior to its release. This will help increase awareness near the time of the book's debut, and also, hopefully, generate some positive buzz as positive reviews come in!</p>
<h2>And that about accounts for it all.</h2>
<p>Stay tuned for more updates next month, at which point we'll be only eight months from the release of <em>Accounting For It All</em>! As I mentioned above, for updates in the meantime, you can <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow me on Twitter</a> and like <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my author page on Facebook.</a></p>
