    <p>Much like July, August of 2017 was an action-packed month in my corner of the writing world. Below you'll find a recap of all the highlights, among which is the publication of another short story.</p>
<h1>Publication - “What It Is To Smell Of Man”</h1>
<p>As detailed <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/08/24/now-published-what-it-is-to-smell-of-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, my short story “What It Is To Smell Of Man” is now available via <em>Erotic Review Magazine</em>. A direct link to the story is available <a href="http://eroticreviewmagazine.com/fiction/what-it-is-to-smell-of-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, though <strong>please note</strong> the story contains <strong>graphic sexual content and adult language.</strong></p>
<p>“What It Is To Smell Of Man” examines troubling stereotypes of masculinity through the lens of a man’s first experiences in a polyamorous relationship. I hope you enjoy reading it!</p>
<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<p>My <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/current-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current projects page</a> still includes both <em>Accounting for it All</em> and <em>EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</em>, though I'll say I also made time for some new short stories this month. They're not submission ready yet, but I'm hopeful I'll have a chance to polish them perhaps later in September.</p>
<p>I'll be waiting until then to revisit those stories, as right now I'm focused on putting some “final” touches on the current draft of <em>Accounting for it All.</em> I've been hitting it hard with that manuscript in preparation for my participation in the #SonofaPitch query event on Twitter, which begins September 11th. I'm really pleased with how this process has been going, and am confident <em>AFIA </em>will be in good shape once Son of a Pitch gets started.</p>
<p>If you'd like more info on Son of a Pitch, you can head to <a href="http://www.kjhstories.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website of its founder</a>, Katie Hamstead, whom I also interviewed about the event as part of an upcoming episode of the r. r. campbell writescast. Watch for her episode's debut on September 1st!</p>
<h1>r. r. campbell writescast</h1>
<p>August saw the debut of two new episodes of the show, including <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-014-writing-as-an-author-with-cerebral-palsy-featuring-steven-salmon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> featuring author Steven Salmon, whom I interviewed by email about his experiences as an author with Cerebral Palsy.</p>
<p>The second episode released in August features guests Scott Birrenkott, who joined me for a conversation on how to strike a balance between the science and the fiction in science fiction. His episode is available <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-015-keeping-the-science-in-science-fiction-and-the-fiction-too-with-scott-birrenkott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also extremely pleased to announce that a boom in listenership led to the writescast eclipsing <strong>1,000 </strong><strong>listens</strong>&#8212;what a milestone! In order to continue growing the podcast, I've now made it available on TuneIn, Overcast, Podcast Land, and Stitcher. There are now more ways than ever to listen to your favorite episodes or get caught up on the show in general!</p>
<p>Starting this fall, the writescast will also be sponsoring a football team. A fantasy football team. For more on the misadventures of the so-called writescast raconteurs, you can follow my blog's new mini-series throughout the season by visiting <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/writescast-raconteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward, September will feature the release of <strong>three new episodes of the show</strong>, so keep an ear out for those on September 1st, 15th, and 29th.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
