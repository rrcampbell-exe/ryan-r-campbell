    <p>July was a great month in my small corner of the writing world. Below, you'll find a recap of the three main highlights from this month, including the publication of my first flash fiction piece.</p>
<h1>Publication - “Wool”</h1>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/07/28/now-published-wool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post</a>, my flash fiction piece “Wool” is now available via Five:2:One Magazine. You can find a direct link to the story <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/wool-r-r-campbell-flash-fiction-thesideshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> if you'd like to either read it or have a listen to the audio version.</p>
<p>Aside from “Wool,” I'm also currently looking for homes for my short stories “What It is to Smell of Man” and “Thank You for the Fire.” I'll be sure to update my blog should publication news come rolling in for either of those as well (fingers crossed!).</p>
<h1>Camp NaNoWriMo 2017 Winner</h1>
<p>I also entered July eager to hop into revisions for <em><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/current-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</a></em>. In order to push myself to keep at them every day, I decided to sign up for Camp NaNoWriMo for the first time. For those of you unfamiliar, Camp NaNoWriMo is an extension of NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month), during which writers are encouraged to set and work toward a monthly writing goal.</p>
<p>After signing up, I spent the first few weeks of the month editing over 50,000 words in the <em>EMPATHY </em>manuscript&#8212;enough to achieve my Camp NaNoWriMo goal! It was great to get back into that story, and though I've now transitioned back into focusing on <em><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/current-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accounting for it All</a></em>, I know my manuscript for <em>EMPATHY</em> is better as a result of the work I put into it.</p>

<h1>r. r. campbell writescast</h1>
<p><a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcasts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The writescast</a> saw the release of three episodes this July, including a <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-013-scene-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bonus episode on scene structure</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that episode, episodes <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-011-perseverance-good-writing-habits-and-working-with-an-editor-featuring-danielle-maurer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eleven</a> and <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-012-promoting-your-work-through-traditional-media-with-valerie-biel/">twelve</a> featuring guests Danielle Maurer and Valerie Biel went live as well. Be sure to listen to both for lessons on the importance of perseverance and how to promote your work through traditional media, respectively!</p>
<p>A final note on the writescast is that it just eclipsed <strong>750 total listens</strong> so far this year! Not only that, but the month of July saw the writescast reach its highest number of average listens per day yet. Thanks to all you listeners for tuning in, and thanks as always to my guests for making the show what it is.</p>
