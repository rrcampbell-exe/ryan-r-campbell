    <p>It's my pleasure to announce that my short story “What It Is To Smell Of Man” has been published online with <em>Erotic Review</em>. It is available to read <a href="http://eroticreviewmagazine.com/fiction/what-it-is-to-smell-of-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (<strong>content warning:</strong> <strong>explicit language and sexual content</strong>).</p>
<p>In keeping with <em>Erotic Review</em>‘s mission to be “an antidote to the dumbing down of sex,” “What It Is To Smell Of Man” examines troubling stereotypes of masculinity through the lens of a man's first experiences in a polyamorous relationship.</p>
<p>You can learn more about <em>Erotic Review </em>on their homepage <a href="http://www.eroticreviewmagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
