<p>I had to win last week (check), this week, and next to claim the crown of the loser's league for the second year running, and as the above shows, I've come up short.</p>
<p>I have failed you. I have failed myself.</p>
<p>Even if I had set the perfect line-up this week (which I certainly didn't do), I would've come up short by 15 points or so. There was just no way to win this week.</p>
<p>So, that's it. I can put forth a decent effort next week to finish somewhere in the middle of the bottom half of the league, but beyond that, there's nothing left to fight for.</p>
<p>Better luck next year, Raconteurs.</p>
