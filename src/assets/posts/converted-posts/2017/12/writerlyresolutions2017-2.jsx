<h2 style="text-align: center;">What's one goal you <em>failed</em> to achieve in 2017? What did you learn from this? What can you do differently next time?</h2>
<p>It's okay! We all come up short sometimes. The important thing in these scenarios isn't the end result, but rather learning from the past so we can achieve a different result next time.</p>
<p>Another goal I had for myself this year was:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Query at least 80 agents for <em>EMPATHY</em>.</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>I managed to query only about 20 agents for <em><a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/current-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</a> </em>this year, but it wasn't for lack of trying that I missed the mark on this one.</p>
<p>Looking back, there are a few reasons I didn't meet the expectation I set for myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>New perspective on manuscript</li>
<li>Change in priorities</li>
<li>Scope of goal itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the first of these is concerned, it was after I hired an editor to take a peek at a selection of the manuscript that made me realize there were still a number of ways I could improve it even further. Armed with a new perspective, I withdrew from the query process entirely so I could focus on retooling the story bit by bit.</p>
<p>As excited as I was to get into those revisions, I quickly realized that I needed some time apart to really be able to reinvent the sections I felt required the most attention. It was then that my priorities changed, pushing me toward writing a completely new manuscript, one that eventually became the current version of <em><a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/current-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accounting for it All</a></em>.</p>
<p>Of course, writing a new manuscript from scratch took resources away from retooling <em>EMPATHY</em>, let alone getting it in query-able shape once more. That's where the scope of my original goal proved a challenge.</p>
<p>With a goal that stretched out over the course of the year rather than over a month or a quarter, I would've had to rush both retooling and querying to meet my originally established goal by the end of 2017, something that sounds not only stressful, but a surefire way to end up with a manuscript of diminished quality.</p>
<p>Going forward, my plan is to finish my revisions by January 2018, and then establish quarter-based querying goals that allow for greater flexibility and benchmarking along the way.</p>
<p>So sure&#8212;I came up short, but I learned SO MUCH in the process. Not only that, but the way this new manuscript is shaping upâ€¦ whew. Hold onto your hats, friends, because I feel like this might be the one.*</p>
<p>*he said, recognizing he's been saying that for a few years now. Someday I have to get it right, though, right? I mean, right?!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Now it's your turn. Tell us about one of the 2017 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23writerlyresolutions&amp;src=typd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#WriterlyResolutions</a> you had, but didn't quite achieve. What happened, and what did you learn from the experience?</h2>
<p>Then, on Friday of this week, tune in for a new writescast episode all about setting goals and maximizing our takeaways from our success (and failures, too!).</p>
