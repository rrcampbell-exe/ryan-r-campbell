<p>Look. at. those. stats. Everyone on the squad bossed up in a big way this week, save for Rishard Matthews and Zuerlein, and no one could be upset with them considering how clutch they've otherwise been throughout the year.</p>
<p>What's great about this victory&#8212;aside from being the most points the team has scored all season&#8212;is that we're still in a great position to win back-to-back championships.</p>
<p>Of the consolation ladder.</p>
<p>For real, though, as I look at this team and how I'm expecting it to perform down the stretch, it's super frustrating to know we missed the playoffs by a single game. This team is like Hansel&#8212;so hot right now&#8212;and had we snuck into the playoffs, I'd be feeling great about our ability to win an actual, not-consolation-bracket championship.</p>
<p>If only I could roll this roster over into next year…</p>
<p>BUT THERE'S NO TIME TO THINK OF NEXT YEAR. We've got two more games to try to win ourselves a (consolation ladder) CHAMPIONSHIP.</p>
