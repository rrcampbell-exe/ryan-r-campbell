<h2 style="text-align: center;">Whatâ€™s one goal you have for 2018? What direct steps will you take to achieve it?</h2>
<p>Over the last few days, we've had a chance to celebrate our last year's success and learn from where we came up short, but today we look forward!</p>
<p>Though I have at least five writerly goals already established for myself for 2018, I'll focus on one in particular for this post, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Publish at least thirty episodes of the writescast</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2017, I published a total of 25 episodes (<a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/podcast/writescast027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including today's new post on writerly resolutions</a>), and I'm aiming to outdo that in 2018.</p>
<p>Thirty episodes may not seem like a lot when you spread it out over the course of 52 weeks, but given the amount of time it takes to source guests, develop questions, conduct interviews, edit them, and then get promotional materials together, it adds up quick.</p>
<p>Not to mention that, you know, I still do like to write from time to time. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>The great thing about the writescast though is that I really enjoy putting each episode together. I love chatting with both return and new guests, and the interaction I get from listeners is all part of what makes doing this podcast worth it. Plus, we ALL learn something over the course of each conversation (I do, at least), which gives me all the more incentive to push for more quality content more often.</p>
<p>Going with thirty episodes is also not as arbitrary a number as it may seem. I selected it by figuring I can do my standard two episodes per month for most of the year, and then in six of the year's twelve months, toss in a bonus episode to get to thirty total. Math. Boom.</p>
<p>In any event, I hope you're looking forward to listening to the episodes as much as I'm looking forward to putting them together.</p>
<p>That's a wrap on #WriterlyResolutions for 2017! Be sure to tell us about your 2018 goals <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23writerlyresolutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> or your own blog, too. Then, once you're done (or while you're working on your post), you can listen to this new episode of the writescast, all about writerly resolutions and goal setting. Happy New Year, and happy writing!</p>
