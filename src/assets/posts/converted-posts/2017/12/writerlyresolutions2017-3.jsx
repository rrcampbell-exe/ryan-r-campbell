<h2 style="text-align: center;">What's an unexpected success that came your way this year? Let's take a moment to celebrate!</h2>
<p>I actually had a fair bit of unexpected success in 2017. I had all but given up writing short fiction until I spoke with Dylan Davis as part of <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-episode-three-dylan-davis-on-flash-fiction-writing-fear-and-publishing-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode three of the writescast</a>, in which we discussed flash fiction and strategies for reaching publication.</p>
<p>After posting that episode, I thought I'd give flash fiction a try, and let the muse take me where it may where a couple of short stories were concerned.</p>
<p>Well, only a handful of months later, I found myself earning my first credit: one of my flash fiction pieces was getting published!</p>
<p>That piece was “Wool,” which is <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/wool-r-r-campbell-flash-fiction-thesideshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available online through <em>Five:2:One Magazine</em></a> as part of their #thesideshow series. I was elated, of course, to be able to share that story with the world via that platform, so I kept pushing myself&#8212;writing more flash pieces and other short works of fiction.</p>
<p>Then, a couple of months after “Wool” was published, “What It Is To Smell Of Man” <a href="http://eroticreviewmagazine.com/fiction/what-it-is-to-smell-of-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found a home with</a><em><a href="http://eroticreviewmagazine.com/fiction/what-it-is-to-smell-of-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Erotic Review</a> </em>(NSFW, 18+). I still think it may be the best thing I've written to date, but given its subject matter, my concern was that I'd never find it a home. Naturally, I was thrilled when the folks at <em>Erotic Review </em>reached out with an interest in publishing it after I'd submitted it to them.</p>
<p>Unlikely as it felt at the time, more unexpected success was still on the way where publication was concerned. My article <a href="http://www.najowrimo.org/40000-flesh-journaled-way-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“40,000 to Flesh: How I Journaled My Way to Character”</a> was published with <em>National Journal Writing Month</em>. In it, I describe my character creation process for <em>Accounting for it All</em>, <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/current-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one my current novel-length projects.</a></p>
<p>So… yeah. 2017 was quite the year where publication was concerned. And, with any luck (and, you know, a great deal of determination) these won't be the last pieces to see the light of day. I'm really looking forward to what 2018 has in store.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Now it's your turn. Tell us about an unexpected success you experienced in 2017. What was it, and how did it affect your writing going forward?</h2>
<p>Then, on Friday of this week, tune in for a new writescast episode all about setting goals and maximizing our takeaways from our success (and failures, too!).</p>
