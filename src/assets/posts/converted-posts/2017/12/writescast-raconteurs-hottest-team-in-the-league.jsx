<p>You read that title right: the Racounteurs' three-game win streak is the best in the league!</p>
<p>Too bad it's too little, too late.</p>
<p>Had we won literally one more game this season, we could have snuck into the playoffs, but that's the way she goes sometimes. Surely I'll spend my remaining years haunted by questions like <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/11/07/writescast-raconteurs-sleep-when-youre-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“What if I hadn't fallen asleep?”</a> “Why did I keep trying to play Eddie Lacy?” “Why does God hate me?”</p>
<p>Seriously, though: all is not lost. Despite my eighth place finish, I still have three games remaining to prove myself a champion&#8212;the champion of the consolation ladder, that is.</p>
<p>My squad did win the losers' bracket last year, so I suppose there is a chance at a repeat championship&#8212;which is nothing to balk at! Well, I mean, it is, but that's not the point.</p>
<p>The point is there are three weeks remaining in this fantasy football adventure, and I plan on RUNNING. THE. TABLE. #CantStopWontStop</p>
