    <p>I may not have done NaNoWriMo this year, but that doesn't mean there weren't big things happening in my corner of the writing world during November. What do we have to look back on? Let's explore below!</p>
<h1>Feedback - Time is Running Out!</h1>
<p>If you're a last minute kind of person, <strong>this is your time to shine.</strong> The deadline to provide feedback on the writescast in exchange for a shot at winning a free manuscript assessment or fifty-page critique is December 10th at 11:59 p.m. CT!</p>
<p><strong>So don't delay. </strong>Get your feedback in now at <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rrcampbellwrites.com/feedback</a>. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
<h1>Back to the Grind</h1>
<p>This month, I returned to working seriously on <em><a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/current-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EMPATHY: Imminent Dawn</a></em>. By year's end, I hope to again be in a position to hit the query road hard after having padded along it briefly to kick off 2017.</p>
<p>Will this revamped manuscript and query be the ones to find a home with a loving agent or press? Only time will tell! Be sure to stay tuned to this site and <a href="http://twitter.com/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my Twitter feed</a> for updates!</p>
<h1>BOOM in Writescast Listenership</h1>
<p>November saw the release of three new episodes (see below for full details), but, in terms of listenership, one sounded off louder than the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Within only five days after its initial release, <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">episode 023 featuring Barbara Britton</a> became the all-time most-listened to episode of the show.</strong> Talk about an impressive guest debut!</p>
<p>If you missed that one, no worries! You can catch it at the link above. I've also already asked Barbara to join me again in 2018, so there'll be another chance to explore a new topic with her when the new year rolls around.</p>
<p>Between her episode and all of the other fantastic content we have on the writescast, <strong>total listenership is up nearly 94% over last quarter. </strong>Thank <strong>you</strong> for guaranteeing the continued success of the show!</p>
<h1>Writescast Recaps</h1>
<p>Here are all three new episodes from November 2017!</p>
