    <p>A new year is just around the corner, which means it's a great time to look back on the last year's progress, while also creating opportunities for 2018!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">That's why <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the writescast</a> and I are introducing <strong>#WriterlyResolutions!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Beginning December 26th</strong>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the writescast will tweet</a> one prompt per day that will ask us to share our success from 2017, or get us thinking forward to what we can accomplish in the coming year.</p>
<p>Using the hashtag #WriterlyResolutions, you can respond to the daily prompt on Twitter in a single tweet, or, if you have a lot to say, you can write a short blog post and share it on Twitter using the same hashtag!</p>
<p><strong>Then, on December 29th</strong>, the writescast will debut a new episode all about setting effective goals and celebrating our successes! <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-episode-eight-meg-gaertner-how-to-handle-rejection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Author Meg Gaertner</a> returns as my guest for this episode, so you know it's one you won't want to miss.</p>
<p>Once that episode goes live, it can be found at <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/podcast/writescast027" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this address.</a></p>
<p>So what do you say? Won't you join me and the writescast for this awesome opportunity to explore how far we've come, and how far we can still go?</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you on the #WriterlyResolutions feed.</p>
