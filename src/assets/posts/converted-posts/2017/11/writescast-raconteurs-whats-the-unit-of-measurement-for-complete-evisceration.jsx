<p>Well, I finally came out on the right side of a drubbing. Not only that, but with all of our players' games having wrapped up on Sunday, I can post this week's results before our records are updated. I'm actually at 5-7 now, which actually gives me an outside shot at the playoffs if I manage to win next week and a few other things go my way.</p>
<p>Next week may prove difficult, though, since production from Jamaal Williams may decrease if Ty Montgomery returns, and Amari Cooper took a devastating hit in his game and may likely miss next week due to a concussion. Rex Burkhead also did great work this week, but I doubt that'll keep up two weeks in a row.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe I'll get lucky, though, and we'll sneak into the playoffs where anything can happen.</p>
