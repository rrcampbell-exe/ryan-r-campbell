<h1>Writing Tip</h1>
<p>This month, I focused on <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/10/13/its-really-okay-to-say-no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how it's really okay to say “no.”</a> In other words, how we can better balance our drive to write against the great number of other things that require tending to in our day-to-day lives. How can we make sure that caring for ourselves as writers doesn't interfere with our general self-care? You can click the link above to read all about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's all for this month, but stay tuned in November. We'll have three writescast episodes and plenty more to be excited about from there. Write on and write well.</p>
