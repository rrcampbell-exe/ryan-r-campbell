<p>The team managed a respectable score this week, which makes this win all the sweeter since I actually didn't simply scrape by after my opponent's squad somehow did more poorly than my own team.</p>
<p>I can also feel good about not having traded with this week's opponent after he offered up Alex Smith and Matt Forte for Russell Wilson and Ted Ginn, Jr. a few weeks back. That alone could have meant defeat in this match-up.</p>
<p>Basically, it's still not impossible for me to sneak into the playoffs if I win out and some other teams stumble, but I'm not counting on it. The new goal? WIN THE CONSOLATION LADDER. WE CAN DO IT. ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.</p>
