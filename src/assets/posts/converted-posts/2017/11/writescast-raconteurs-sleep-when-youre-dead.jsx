<p>Yes, you're seeing that correctly: a one point loss. Exactly one point.</p>
<p>Rarely do scores end up as close as this that in the world of fantasy football, and this time I've come out on the wrong side of the one point difference. There are a few things I could have done differently to save the day, but the one thing I did that absolutely doomed me this week… was take a nap.</p>
<p>Hear me out. At about 10 a.m. on Sunday, I had my line-up all ready to go. I had no reason to believe there'd be any last-minute changes necessary. So I did the reasonable thing: I started reading on the couch, and, sometime around 11:00 a.m., I fell asleep.</p>
<p>I awoke at 12:15 p.m. to realize that games had started, and that, much to my surprise (and terror), LEONARD FOURNETTE WASN'T STARTING AS THE JAGUARS RUNNING BACK.</p>
<p>“Who cares?” you might say. “It's not like you have Leonard Fournette on your team.”</p>
<p>And I don't. But I do have his back-up, Chris Ivory. And guess who scored 11.9 points on my bench? Chris Ivory. Those points would have been enough to win by a reasonable margin, while also leaving me with a more respectable score line.</p>
<p>If only I'd been awake at around 11:15 a.m. when it was announced that Ivory would be starting instead of Fournette, I could have made the change and come out a happy camper this week. Instead, my season is basically trashed. Even if I win out, the chances of me making the playoffs at this point are close to zero.</p>
<p>I guess the moral of the story is don't sleep when you're on the clock, sleep when you're dead. Or something. Woof.</p>
