<p>I chose the title of this post purposely: my team did show up, they did see some good results, but we ultimately came up short&#8212;not because they were trash this week, but because our opponent happened to go off in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>The good news is I can now surrender any hope of the playoffs and look instead to trying my best in the consolation ladder. I have an advantageous waiver wire position this week, which will allow me to make some improvements at running back, where I've been in bad shape for some time.</p>
<p>Here's to hoping there's some kind of payoff for remaining diligent.</p>
