<p>Every part of this week went poorly. The execution was shite from everyone on the squad&#8212;myself included, as I made a number of roster moves and substitutions that left us with far fewer points than could have otherwise been earned.</p>
<p>The good(?) news is that even if I <em>had</em> made the right calls, the team still would have lost by about six points. What I'm trying to say is that for the second week in a row, we had no chance because players on my opponents' teams KEEP POPPING OFF WHEN I PLAY THEM.</p>
<p>Here's what to look forward to in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will stop panicking and replacing guys who underperform for a single week</li>
</ul>
<p>And that'sâ€¦ I don't know. I think that might be it. Basically, I need to rethink my approach to setting the lineup and playing the waiver wire each week. There's a way forward; I just have to put a little more care into finding it.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I could focus on getting my synopsis together for <em><a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/current-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accounting for it All</a></em>, since completing it is the only thing keeping me from having a complete query package put together.</p>
<p>I'll let you guess which priority might win out over the course of the coming weeks. ðŸ™‚</p>
