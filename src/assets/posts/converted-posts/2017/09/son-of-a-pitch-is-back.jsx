<h2><strong>Title: </strong><em>Accounting for it All</em></h2>
<h2><strong>Category and Genre: </strong>Adult, Romantic Suspense</h2>
<h2><strong>Word Count:</strong> 89,000</h2>
<h2><strong>Query</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When porn-star-turned-accountant Robin Whethers becomes the center of an IRS audit, she figures things can’t get any worse: she had no idea she was part of an apparently vast money laundering scheme, and to top it off, she has no real accounting knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, somehow the audit is the least of her problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanging over her is the impending death of her terminally ill mother, to whom Robin is estranged. Then there’s the accounting instructor she enlists to help her survive the audit: against her better judgement, she can’t manage to contain her blossoming feelings for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and the woman Robin considers to be the love of her life? She’s back in town, finally ready to try and make things work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robin might’ve thought she could confront her greatest challenge by learning to juggle numbers, but if she’s to ever be whole, she’ll have to learn how to juggle much more than that… before she winds up in jail, her mother passes, and the woman she loves disappears from her life once more.</span></p>

<h2><strong>First 250 Words</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">Thursdays are my favorite days at Pornucopia.</p>
<p class="p1">Is it payday? Yeah. In-house filming day? Yes. Am I glad to know I’ll actually get to work as a talent consultant? Of course.</p>
<p class="p1">But it’s the simple things that make Thursdays the best of days, and there isn’t anything more predictable than the Thursday morning safe-looting operation.</p>
<p class="p1">As soon as I’ve cleared out the safe, I’ll round the corner from my own office and into Jerry’s. “Hey, Jer?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Yeah, Robin?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Only got a few thousand in the safe this week. Still want me to—?”</p>
<p class="p1">He’ll throw his hands up, looking all exasperated. “Always. Go. To. The. Bank. Every Thursday. No matter how much or how little is in there. Always. Go. To. The. Bank.”</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll repeat “always go to the bank” with him as he says it for the second time. “Right,” I’ll add. “How could I forget?”</p>
<p class="p1">“Never forget.” He’ll say it as he takes a big old bite of his first ham sandwich of the day. Beneath that ham-sandwich smile and double chin of his, though, he’s dead serious. Jerry's the big man in charge of all two of us in accounting, and I’ve got no intention of breaking the department’s only rule, especially since he’s the only person actually doing any accounting around here—and because he’s the only one that <i>knows </i>he’s the only person doing any accounting around here.</p>
<p class="p1">And getting paid for five days of work a week when I really only have one? I’m in no hurry to push for a change.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and for your feedback. And best of luck to all SoaP entrants! Happy writing.</p>
