<p style="text-align: center;">So far we've raised $40 for hurricane relief, but we can still unlock up to $160 more!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;">In the aftermath of the historic damage caused by Hurricane Harvey and with Hurricane Irma continuing to bear down on Florida, supporting relief efforts in Texas, Florida, and throughout the Caribbean will be critical in the coming days, weeks, and months.</p>
<p>That's why I've decided to launch the Writescast for Relief Campaign.</p>
<p>Starting Friday, September 8th and running through Friday, September 15th, I'll donate $10 to the United Way Relief Fund for hurricane-relief efforts for every new patron (up to twenty patrons) that signs up to support the writescast <a href="http://www.patreon.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over on Patreon</a>.</p>
<p>The Writescast for Relief Campaign means there's never been a better time to contribute to your favorite podcast by writers, for writers. Not only will you still reap the benefits of whichever donation tier you choose, you'll also be supporting hurricane-relief efforts for those devastated by these recent storms.</p>
<p>If you'd like more information about the writescast or the rewards available to donors, you can learn more by watching the video below, <a href="http://www.patreon.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or by visiting the writescast Patreon page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support. Write on, write well, and take care of one another.</p>
