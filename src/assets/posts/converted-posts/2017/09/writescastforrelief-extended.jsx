    <p>As clean-up continues in both Texas and Florida, it's just as critical as ever that those most affected by these storms receive as much support as possible. That's why I've decided to extend the <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/09/07/writescast-for-relief-hurricane-season-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writescast for Relief Campaign</a> for one additional week.</p>
<p>That is to say, <strong>from now until 11:59 p.m. CST on September 22, I will continue to donate $10 for every new patron that signs up at <a href="http://www.patreon.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patreon.com/writescast</a>&nbsp;</strong>(up to twenty total patrons).&nbsp;Please show your support for both the writing podcast you love and those whose lives have been upended by hurricanes Harvey and Irma through a contribution of even just $1 per episode.</p>
<p>So far we have raised $40, but let's not leave any money on the table&#8212;<strong>there's still plenty of time to reach our $200 goal.</strong></p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.patreon.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patreon.com/writescast</a> now to make your contribution. Write on, write well, and take care of one another.</p>
