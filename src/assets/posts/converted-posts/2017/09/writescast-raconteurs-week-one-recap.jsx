We didn't score the fewest points of any team in the league, but we were dang near close.</p>
<p>Honestly, though, it's not the loss or the lack of points on the board that were most devastating, but rather the injuries that got us here. As we'll cover shortly, I can't blame the low point total exclusively on injuries, but they sure didn't help.</p>
<p>Let's dive in with a recap of the post-draft and week one<em> <strong>low</strong>lights</em> first.</p>
<h2>Lowlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Round two draft pick, Spencer Ware, declared out for season after suffering pre-season injury</li>
<li>Drafted kicker Cairo Santos listed as doubtful after suffering injury
<ul>
<li>dropped from Raconteurs lineup</li>
<li>replaced with Caleb Sturgis</li>
<li>Cairo Santos plays anyway</li>
<li>Caleb Sturgis injures self in week one game, will not play next week</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Round one draft pick, Odell Beckham Junior, has high ankle sprain and misses first week of play</li>
<li>After learning team member Thomas Rawls is not expected to play due to injury, I sub in Eddie Lacy, who presumably would've gotten Rawls' share of carries
<ul>
<li>This did not happen</li>
<li>Lacy did a bad job</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah&#8212;injuries. They affect everyone, though, so it'll be about how those guys heal and what waiver moves are made going forward. With that in mind, let's explore some highlights.</p>
<p>Well, maybe not highlights, but reasons for optimism going forward.</p>
<h2>“Highlights”</h2>
<ul>
<li>OBJ should be back next week</li>
<li>I now know to never use Eddie Lacy again, basically (sorry, Eddie)</li>
<li>Randall Cobb had a great game</li>
<li>As did Corey Coleman, who was on my bench this week
<ul>
<li>If only I'd flexed him or Cobb into Lacy's spot…</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kickers are more or less expendable</li>
<li>There are still a ton of weeks left to figure this out</li>
</ul>
<p>The mood in the locker room could be better, but, just like a writer's journey, ups and downs are to be expected.</p>
<p>Let's start working toward an upswing beginning with week two.</p>
