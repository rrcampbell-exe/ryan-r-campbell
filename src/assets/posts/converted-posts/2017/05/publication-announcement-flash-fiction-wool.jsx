    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Update: </strong>The date of publication for this piece has been pushed back to July 28th, 2017.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/">Five:2:One Magazine</a> will be publishing my flash fiction piece “Wool” on its website beginning July 7th, 2017 as part of its #thesideshow series for art, micro-poetry, and flash fiction.</p>
<p>In addition to the text version of the story, I'll be making an audio telling available through Five:2:One as well.</p>
<p>“Wool” is the story of a young child's first, unexpected experience with poverty. It is my first piece of work to make it to publication.</p>
<p>For more from Five:2:One, you can follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/five2onemag">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/five2onemag/">Facebook</a>. Updates on the publication of “Wool” and future pieces can be found on this blog or my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/iamrrcampbell">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iamrrcampbell/">Facebook</a> feeds.</p>
