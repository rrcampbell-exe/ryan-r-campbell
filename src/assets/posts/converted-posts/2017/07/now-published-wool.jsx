    <p>I'm pleased to announce that <em>Five:2:One Magazine</em> has published my flash fiction piece “Wool.” It is available in both text and audio format at <a href="http://five2onemagazine.com/wool-r-r-campbell-flash-fiction-thesideshow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this address</a>.</p>
<p>“Wool” is the story of a young boy's first and unexpected experience with poverty.</p>
<p>According to its About Us page, <em>Five:2:One</em> is dedicated to the transgressive, experimental, and the  progressive of the literary world. Aside from the magazine's #thesideshow series in which “Wool” has been posted, <em>Five:2:One</em> also publishes a quarterly print journal that features fiction, non-fiction, poetry, art, and more.
