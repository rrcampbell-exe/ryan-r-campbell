<p>It's a win (finally!). Not only did we finally come away with a victory, but I also managed to maximize our points by playing to highest-scoring player available at every position from my roster (with one minor exception, but let's ignore that for now).</p>
<p>So yay! Things are looking up, right?</p>
<h1>Wrong.</h1>
<p>Despite drafting six running backs in the draft, I'm now down to three usable backs. Chris Carson, my big waiver wire pickup from a couple of weeks ago, suffered a broken ankle in this week's game, which will leave him sidelined until December 3rd at the earliest.</p>
<p>So yeah… I'm left with the incredibly underwhelming Isaiah Crowell or the not-so-high-scoring Shane Vereen to fill that role.</p>
<p>Let's hope the waiver wire is good to me this week, though it probably won't be since I am literally last for waiver priority after my moves in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Without additional help at running back, the outlook will remain grim going forward. No matter how well everyone else performs, I doubt I'll be able to scrape by with an RB2 scoring around six points per game (if I'm even that lucky).</p>
<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>I'm not ready to phone in the season yet, but… well, if I can't string a couple of Ws together here, this season may be over before we're even a third of the way through.</p>
