<p>See that? Yeah, that scoreboard. I guess we just beat the best team in the league?</p>
<p>Fantasy football is weird.</p>
<p>I felt like I'd be mailing it in this week, especially considering the entirety of my bench was on a bye week except for Eddie Lacy, who, let's be honest, shouldn't be on any team at this point anyway. But, as fate would have it, Russell went off and Isaiah Crowell had a game that made him finally feel worth having drafted.</p>
<p>Add all of that on top of some average to slightly-below-average performances from everyone else, and I guess that's how you win games.</p>
<p>Granted, my opponent did have a number of players come up short relative to their expectations, but he also had Deshaun Watson keep pace with Russell, so that more or less neutralized the effort from Mr. “Whole Pack of Badgers” himself.</p>
<p>What we're now left with is:</p>
<p>“What do you think the chances of a guy like you and a girl like me ending up in the fantasy-football playoffs together?”</p>
<p>“I'd say… like one out of a million.”</p>
<p>“So you're telling me there's a chance.”</p>
<p>… stay tuned.</p>
