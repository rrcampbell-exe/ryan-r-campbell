<p>Pitiful. Just pitiful.</p>
<p>I actually had a chance this week after Tom Brady and Gillislee had an <em>Unfall</em> in their collective <em>Hose</em>. Then, in true Raconteurs fashion, we somehow managed to have an even greater <em>accidente</em> in our collective <em>pantalones</em>.</p>
<p>Undperformances from literally every member of the team save for the kicker and OBJ doomed us from the get-go.</p>
<p>But it only gets worse.</p>
<p>After already having lost a number of players to season-ending injuries earlier in the season, we lost our newfound TE Charles Clay for an indefinite amount of time due to a knee injury. Then, of course, we lost our best player and number one overall pick, OBJ, to a season-ending ankle injury.</p>
<p>That's it. There's no hope now. I don't even have anyone worth trading away to stack up at a single position.</p>
<p>If we manage to win a single game going forward, that will be more than I'd expect.</p>
<p><em>*sigh*</em></p>
<p>Better literal luck next year, I guess.</p>
