    <p>It's hard to believe September's already come to an end. As usual, it was a super eventful month&#8212;so much so that I had a hard time narrowing this post down to the main three headlines. Let's take them one by one, shall we?</p>
<h1>The Writescast for Relief Campaign</h1>
<p>In light of the hurricanes that ravaged Texas and Florida, I launched the Writescast for Relief Campaign, where for every new patron that pledged their support at <a href="http://www.patreon.com/writescast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patreon.com/writescast</a>, I'd donate $10 to the United Way's hurricane relief efforts. In total, we raised $50 for hurricane relief, which, though it may not seem like a lot, surely went a long way to support those who needed help in those areas.</p>
<p>On that note, though the Writescast for Relief Campaign may have come to an end, we can't forget about those whose lives were absolutely devastated by Hurricane Maria when it struck Puerto Rico weeks ago. If you're able, please consider donating to <a href="http://unidosporpuertorico.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this relief fund</a> to help them through this horrific time.</p>
<h1>Son of a Pitch Finalist</h1>
<p>The query event <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/podcast/writescast-016-query-event-son-of-a-pitch-with-katie-hamstead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Son of a Pitch</a> took place in September, and I'm proud to say I had a query selected as a finalist in the event for the second time running. It was a great opportunity to both give and receive feedback on queries, and I encourage anyone who's ready to query to participate when Son of a Pitch returns in February of 2018.</p>
<p>For this installment of Son of a Pitch, I submitted my query for <em>Accounting for it All.</em> An updated version of the query can be found on the <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/current-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Current Projects page</a>. Thanks to the great feedback I received, I've now started querying this manuscript. Stay tuned for updates on how that adventure goes as I get deeper and deeper into it.</p>
<h1>Publication: “40,000 to Flesh”</h1>
<p>September marked the third month running that I had a piece reach publication. This time around, it was a bit of non-fiction in which I describe the steps that went into creating the characters for <em>Accounting for it All</em>. You can find the full text of this article on <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2017/09/07/now-published-40000-to-flesh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website for National Journal Writing Month</a>.</p>
