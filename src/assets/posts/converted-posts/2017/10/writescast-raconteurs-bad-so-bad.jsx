<p>There was a modicum of hope going into the Sunday night game that I might be able to pull off an upset, but then, of course, the then-winless Giants kicked the Broncos in the teeth, and CJ Anderson laid a triceratops-sized egg.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Isaiah Crowell did decently (relatively speaking), and the Vikings defense had a fantastic day against the now Aaron Rodgers-less Packers (as a Wisconsinite, this is a statewide tragedy). These performances plus that of my freshly picked up TE Austin Seferian-Jenkins give me some hope going forward, but I know that hope will ultimately be misplaced.</p>
<p>There's no way out. This is my fantasy football nightmare.</p>
<p>May the football gods prove themselves more merciful going forward.</p>
