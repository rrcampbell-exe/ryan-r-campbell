<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to speak directly to novelists now, particularly those who are <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2020/04/23/lets-talk-querying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">querying</a>, as one's querying quest is, almost universally, rife with far more rejection than acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It becomes all too easy, then, to look at one's querying statistics and fret whether our work is good enough, whether it will ever find a home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as we'll see in the following exploration of my current querying journey, there are ways to reframe our querying statistics such that they encourage us rather than disparage us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So let's explore the <em>how </em>of this by using my manuscript <em>When the Stars Conspire</em></span>—<span style="font-weight: 400;">or, as I have nicknamed it, “cranberries”</span>—<span style="font-weight: 400;">as an example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why cranberries? Because it takes place on a cranberry farm in northern Wisconsin. Why <em>When the Stars Conspire</em>? Hopefully the one sentence pitch for this manuscript helps clarify that.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After narrowly surviving a plane crash, a mysterious pilot with amnesia and a rural Wisconsin cranberry farmer must rediscover a shared past while overcoming otherworldly foes—from within and without—in order to secure a future for all sentient life in the universe.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew. There’s a lot there. Is this the perfect pitch? Probably not, but the good news is I don’t have to use it all that often—yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, I am, in fact, querying this manuscript, but so far, I’ve been able to rely on a different hook to kick off every one of my queries. And that hook?</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zachary Carmichael is going to die, and all he’s left with are questions.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bump. Set. Spike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I’m proud of that opening line, but what has it and the rest of my query earned me? We'll crunch the numbers momentarily, but first, some context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking the representation of a literary agent is a daunting endeavor, and this manuscript would know. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second time it’s been on query road, in fact, after I was off</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ered a contract for this novel in 2018. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ultimately turned down this contract when it became apparent the small press that offered it would not be a good fit for me or my work, and after refusing that contract, I simply never got back to sending it elsewhere until after I'd completed a new round of revisions in March 2020.</span></p>
<p>But I've been back at it since then, and here are the numbers thus far—</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">52 queries sent</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 pending with no response</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two partial requests</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One full manuscript request</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">25 rejections</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These numbers won’t add up, but that’s because one of those partial requests would later prove to be a rejection. That said, for the purposes of this conversation, we'll ensure we give credit where credit is due and at least acknowledge the fact a partial request was made.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That aside, what does any of this mean? Twenty-five rejections could feel like a lot. Even if rejections don’t quite sting as much as they used to, it feels like we’re at almost a ninety-five percent rejection rate, at least based on the raw numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But let’s dig further and see if we can frame these statistics a bit differently for ourselves,  which I feel will be especially helpful if you’re someone who’s querying and confronting this yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s ignore the 25 pending queries with no response so far. After all, we can’t say it’s a rejection and we can’t say it’ll be a partial or full request yet either. Think of these as Schrödinger’s submissions. They’re both alive and dead at the same time, and knowing that doesn’t really do us any good either way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Schrödinger’s submissions set aside, however, we then have a total of 27 queries with the below breakdown.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">One full request</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two partial requests</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 outright rejections</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we'll ignore that one of those partials would later become a rejection; we can’t assume all partial requests will eventually become rejections, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at these statistics, our hit rate is now eleven percent!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on these numbers, we’d expect approximately eleven percent of those pending submissions to become either partial or full requests, which would mean, of the 25 still-pending queries, we could see another three partial or full requests come in!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, rather than focusing on the prospect of another wave of rejections rolling in, doesn’t it feel better to know there are a handful of agents out there, who, if the numbers can be believed, will, in the coming weeks or months, be reaching out to ask for more?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I cherish the thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps that’s a thought worth keeping in mind for all of us. Whether we’re querying now, have queried in the past, or will query in the future, remember the querying process is a numbers game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than that, really, it’s a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">people </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because on the other end of every one of those queries is another reader, a prospective cheerleader and advocate for your work. On the other end of every one of those queries is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">person</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You just have to have the patience to find the right one for you and for your work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So does this help, listener? Does it hurt? What are the numbers looking like for you on your querying journey?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share them with me in the comments below. Tell me how much you’re looking forward to that next partial or full request rolling in. Tell me, too, if you’re worried about your query, about your synopsis, about your pitch in general. I want to help. We all do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, and I promise you this is true, I want to see your book and my book side by side on the same bookshelf someday.</span></p>
