    <p>It may only be January, but you better believe I've got a number of events already lined up for this new year. So when and where will you be able to find me in person?</p>
<p>So far, these are my confirmed appearance dates with links to the events in question.</p>

<p>At this year's Writers' Institute, I'll be… busy. Extremely busy. But that's a good thing! Rather than have me enumerate all of my sessions and one-on-one coaching availability here, you can find an (almost) full list <a href="https://uwwritersinstitute.wisc.edu/speakers/r-r-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link.</a></p>

<p>Write by the Lake is an intensive, week-long retreat that's been described as “like two semesters of an MFA program.” At Write by the Lake, I'll be teaching a three-day course called <em>Treasure ho! Mapping Your Way to Story</em>.</p>
<p>I'll also be presenting a special, one-hour session called <em>Roll With the Punches, Then Punch Back! Writing One's Way Through Disappointment, Grief, and Glee</em>.</p>
