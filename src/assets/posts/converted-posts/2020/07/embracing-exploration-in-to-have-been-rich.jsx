    <p>I'm trying something new as I write.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm working on a manuscript I'm calling TO HAVE BEEN RICH. When I say it's an exploration of family and what it means to grow into oneself, I'm using the word “exploration” in more ways than one.</p>
<p>It's an exploration thematically, yes, but it's also been a highly exploratory process to write the manuscript itself. Ordinarily, I write in a very linear fashion. Chapter one is written before chapter two, ad infinitum (or at least, you know, ad “the end”).</p>
<p>For TO HAVE BEEN RICH, however, I find myself writing a snippet of a chapter here, a piece of another there, and then I leave notes sprinkled in between about what, later, I might do to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>It's taken a few days of adjustment to this new-to-me method, but I have, so far, found it <strong>an absolute</strong> <strong>joy</strong> to really embody the essence of the word “explore” as I write.</p>
<p>The opening line of TO HAVE BEEN RICH may be “It was over the first time they tried,” but, for me, I will keep trying to write this way, embracing the unending journey of growth.</p>
<p>What are you doing to bring joy into your creative process?</p>
