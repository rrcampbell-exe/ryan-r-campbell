<p>I'm thrilled to share I've been elected to the board of directors for the Wisconsin Writers Association!</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://wiwrite.org/about-wwa-2" target="_blank">Per their website</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>The Wisconsin Writers Association is a nonprofit organization that encourages, educates, supports and promotes writers through its programs and services.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Wisconsin Writers Association has been serving writers since 1948, and it's an honor to have been elected to the Craft Development Chairperson position.</p>



<p>I look forward to working with writers within the state and beyond to bring you the very best educational content on the craft and business of writing.</p>



<p>More to come!</p>
