<p>After having read—and loved—her <em>An American Marriage</em> in 2020, I knew I had to kick off 2021 with <em>Silver Sparrow</em> by Tayari Jones.</p>



<p>As expected, Jones has, in <em>Silver Sparrow</em>, created another absolutely spellbinding family saga that teems with soft tension throughout.</p>



<p>And it's no wonder how: with its two POV characters being young women who share the same bigamist father—and with only one of those young women being privy to that fact—the book sets you up for an unavoidable collision course from its very first sentence.</p>



<p>So, if you haven't read this one (or <em>An American Marriage</em>, for that matter), give it a read. Today. Now. Yesterday.</p>



<p><em>4/5 stars.</em></p>
