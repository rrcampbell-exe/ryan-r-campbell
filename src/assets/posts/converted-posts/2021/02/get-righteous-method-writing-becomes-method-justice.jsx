<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/2020/12/21/tis-the-season-for-method-writing/" target="_blank">In previous blog posts</a>, I mentioned how&nbsp;I'd taken to messing with the scammers in my spam folder<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in order to better understand the protagonist of my work in progress, <em>Scambait</em>.</p>



<p>Things have, shall we say, escalated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last week Friday,&nbsp;after having collected wire transfer information from a scammer<strong>&nbsp;</strong>who claimed he'd send me $350,000 after I first sent him $550 as a service fee,&nbsp;<strong>I called their bank to report the account for fraudulent activity.</strong></p>



<p>How did it go? You can watch the video for yourself below. </p>

<p>Let's just say&nbsp;I definitely plan to keep doing this, not only&nbsp;to continue to research my work in progress, but to also&nbsp;advance the cause of justice&nbsp;in whatever little ways I can.</p>



<p><strong>Every Tuesday, I'll now be streaming similar scambait videos</strong> <strong>live on Twitch.</strong> Tuning it costs nothing but the time you take to join me and others in the text chat, and we often make time to discuss topics outside the realm of scambaiting. </p>



<p>To ensure you never miss a stream, <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.twitch.tv/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank">visit my channel here</a> and click the purple follow button</strong>. </p>



<p>The big takeaway here? Research can be fun. It can be more than fun.</p>



<p>Research can be justice.</p>
