<p>In the aftermath of discovering the awesome power that comes with turning method writing into method justice, I've been inspired to use the power of platform to do more than take down scammers.</p>



<p>I'm now planting trees with help from OneTreePlanted.org, <strong>and you can help me plant even more.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What We're Doing</h2>



<p>Are you familiar with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trex-runner.com/" target="_blank">T-Rex Runner</a> game that pops up on Google Chrome when your internet connection goes down? Yeah, it's the one where you press the spacebar to get your dinosaur to jump over cacti while running through the desert. </p>



<p>But it's become so much more than a simple browser game.</p>



<p>Now, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http:/www.twitch.tv/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank">I play it a few times a week on Twitch</a> while <strong>chatting with viewers about recent writerly angst on Twitter, scams and scambaiting, and anything else you're interested in </strong>bringing up while we plant trees together.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How You Can Help</h2>



<p>These trees won't plant themselves. But <strong>how, exactly, does playing a dinosaur game on the internet plant trees?</strong> Good question.</p>



<p><strong>We plant trees whenâ€”</strong></p>



<ul><li>a dinosaur cracks the top five high scores. <ul><li>When this happens, <strong>I donate five dollars to plant five trees</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>a viewer becomes a follower of my channel. <ul><li>When a new follower comes aboard, <strong>I donate one dollar to plant one tree</strong> (up to fifty total followers).</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>It's that simple, and <strong>you can plant one tree <em>right now</em> by simply <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.twitch.tv/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank">following me on Twitch.</a></strong> To follow me, <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit my channel and click on the purple follow button.</a> That's it! That's all!<strong> Following my channel will plant a tree and make for a greener planet.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ash Cracks the Leaderboard and Plants Five Trees</h2>



<p>Did I mention we name the dinosaurs who bravely hop cacti to raise funds for forestation? We do. Our most recent chart-climbing run was by Ash (we name all of the dinosaurs after trees, starting last week), and you can catch Ash's moment in the sun in the highlight video below.</p>
