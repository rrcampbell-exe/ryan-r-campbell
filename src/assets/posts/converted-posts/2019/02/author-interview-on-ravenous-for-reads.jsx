    <p>Ari Augustine of Ravenous for Reads was kind enough to have me on her Ravenous for Reads blog for an author interview! Naturally, we discuss <em>Imminent Dawn</em> a great deal, but there are some really fun questions and answers at the end of this one, too!</p>
<p><a href="https://ravenousforreads.com/qa-with-r-r-campbell-author-of-imminent-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">So check it out now</a>, and don't forget to watch for a review of <em>Imminent Dawn </em>from Ravenous for Reads in the coming days.</p>
<p>Still need to get a copy of the book that debuted at number one for new releases in LGBT sci-fi on Amazon? You can find it at the links below!</p>
