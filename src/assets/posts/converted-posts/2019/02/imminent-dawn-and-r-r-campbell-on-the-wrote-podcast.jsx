<p>Over the course of this interview, we explore the book, the technology behind it, and what, exactly, is meant by the episode title, “Quote-Unquote-Fun.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wrotepodcast.com/r-r-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tune in now</a> for a laugh or two, and you might even learn something new along the way. And if you haven't yet picked up your copy of <em>Imminent Dawn</em>, you can do so at the links below!</p>
