    <p>Another review has rolled in!</p>
<p>Though <em>Imminent Dawn </em>has been receiving high praise over on Goodreads since its release last week, <a href="https://ravenousforreads.com/imminent-dawn-empathy-1-by-r-r-campbell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this in-depth review by Ari Augustine on Ravenous for Reads</a> offers a lot to love, too.</p>
<p>Once you've had a chance to check out Ari's review, be sure to pick up your copy at any one of the links below. I hope you enjoy <em>Imminent Dawn </em>as much as Ari did.</p>
