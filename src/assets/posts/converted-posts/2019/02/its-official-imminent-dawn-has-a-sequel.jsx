<p>Want to learn more? You can, <strong>but only</strong> <strong>if you're willing to embrace spoilers. </strong>Before I copy and paste the full back-of-book content below, might I add you can already <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43728390-mourning-dove" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>add <em>Mourning Dove </em></strong><strong>on Goodreads</strong></a>? <em>But be careful!</em> The book's full description is listed there as well, which would be spoilery for sure.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Mourning Dove</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Book Blurb</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of the calamitous Human/Etech research study, Chandra and Kyra struggle to reclaim the life they shared in a pre-EMPATHY world, while Ty, armed with knowledge of EMPATHY’s programming language, seeks revenge on the Halmans for the harm that’s befallen his friends.</p>
<p>As a North American Union investigation into the happenings on the compound looms, a grief-stricken Peter works to resurrect the memory of his mother from a harvested nanochip, and Heather scrambles to keep her family—and their company—together. Alistair, having abandoned the family business, plots to save his hide and that of his wife while she strives to stay one step ahead of a husband she has no reason to trust.</p>
<p>Far to the north amid civil unrest, a recently retired Rénald Dupont investigates the disappearance of his friend and former colleague, Meredith, despite grave threats from an increasingly skittish North American Union government.</p>
<p>As old and new foes emerge, spouse is further pit against spouse, brother against sister, and governments against their people. In the end, all must choose between attempts to reclaim the past or surrender to the inevitable, an intractable world of their own creation.</p>
<p><em>Mourning Dove</em> is an evocative, sweeping symphony of love, revenge, and desperation in cacophonous times. It is the second installment in r. r. campbell’s epic EMPATHY sci-fi saga.</p>
