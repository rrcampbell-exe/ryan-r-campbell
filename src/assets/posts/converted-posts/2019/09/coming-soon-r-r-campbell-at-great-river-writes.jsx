    <p>It's been a couple of months since my last in-person writing workshop, which makes me all the more pleased to announce I'll be conducting two seminars this October for Great River Writes!</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GreatRiverWrites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their Facebook page</a>, Great River Writes is a “collaboration between several literary and arts organizations in La Crosse, Wisconsin &amp; Winona, Minnesota” that brings writing events to the Midwest!</p>
<p>The two sessions I'll be leading that day are <strong>“I don't know what to do with my hands” - Touching Up Scene for Characterization, Theme, and Backstory</strong> and <strong>Let's (Not) Do Lunch: Pushing Our Settings Past Bars, Restaurants, and Cafes</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>A full description of both courses can be found on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2460550484222941/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the event page on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>This event is free and open to the public. For more information, please visit the event page link above.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Great River Writes for this opportunity. See you there!</p>
