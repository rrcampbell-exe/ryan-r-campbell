    <p>I'm pleased to formally announce the release date and title for book three in the EMPATHY series.</p>
<p>Book three, <em>Event Horizon</em>, will be published with NineStar Press on <strong>March 2nd, 2020.</strong></p>
<p>The excitement is very real. I'm actively working on the manuscript's final deep-structure changes, and being back in the world of EMPATHY has me more invigorated than ever to introduce you to the saga's next thrilling installment.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1192" src="https://empathynovel.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/emp-twitter-1.png?resize=1024%2C512" alt="EMP Twitter (1).png" width="1024" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2>What can you expect?</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Reader beware: spoilers follow for </em>Imminent Dawn <em>and </em>Mourning Dove.</span></p>
<p><em>Event Horizon</em> will focus heavily on Ty and his trials in the Merry Hacksters' lair, the Vermont TeddyCo basement. We'll also see plenty of Chandra and Kyra as they continue to confront the decisions they've made on how to best handle EMPATHY and their relationships with each other (and with themselves) going forward.</p>
<p>We'll also get perspective chapters for a longtime character whose “head” we haven't yet hopped into (wink, wink). Beyond that, characters we haven't seen or heard from (or might not have expected to see or hear from any longer) in some time  will (re-)emerge as key players in the broader world's struggles.</p>
<p>But who are these characters and what role will they play? You'll have to wait until March 2020 to find out.</p>
<h2>“Hey, wait a minute…”</h2>
<p>What about the Halman siblings? What about Ren and Gary? What about the election and the New Québec Liberation Front? All of that hasn't disappeared, has it?</p>
<p>It has not, no. In fact, those characters and plots will return in perspective chapters in book four of the EMPATHY series, tentatively titled <em>Rubicon</em>. The events of <em>Rubicon </em>will be concurrent to those of <em>Event Horizon</em>, similar to how the events of George R.R. Martin's <em>A Dance With Dragons </em>and <em>A Feast for Crows </em>are portrayed.</p>
<h2>Why choose to do this?</h2>
<p>In an ideal world, I'd present every chapter chronologically with every perspective character in the same, single volume. As my original vision for <em>Event Horizon </em>took shape, however, it became apparent that the quantity of content would not allow it all to be physically contained in a single book.</p>
<p>Yes, <em>Event Horizon </em>will be a long one, the longest book in the series so far.</p>
<h2>When will book four be released?</h2>
<p>I do have an early draft of <em>Rubicon </em>complete for the majority of that installment's perspective characters, but there is much work left to do. At this time, we do not have a tentative publication date for book four available, though my goal is to aim for a 2021 release.

<h2>“Okay, I'm excited. How can I get my hands on an early copy of <em>Event Horizon</em>?”</h2>
<p>As always, ARCs will be made available on NetGalley. I can also provide a limited number of ARCs to other interested readers. If you would like an advance copy of <em>Event Horizon </em>to review on Goodreads, Amazon, your blog, or other social media, <a href="https://forms.gle/uhKbQiR8KCVzoc6P6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please let me know here.</a></p>
<p>It is my goal to work with NineStar Press to have ARCs available in January 2020.</p>
<h2>“This series sounds awesome, but I haven't read the first two installments. How can I get started?”</h2>
