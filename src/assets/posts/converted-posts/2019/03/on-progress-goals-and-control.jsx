    <p>It's beenâ€¦ an interesting weekend.</p>
<p>My in-laws invited my wife and I to visit, but I elected to stay home to make a sizable dent in my revisions for <em>Event Horizon</em>, the third book in my <a href="http://www.empathyseries.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EMPATHY series</a>. With the place to myself (aside from my cats), I figured I'd have no problem doing all the things, as they say, but boy oh boy, was I wrong.</p>
<p>I'd set <a href="https://twitter.com/iamrrcampbell/status/1111966326577393664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a goal of getting through 18 chapters</a>, but after three or four, I realized I had a problem&#8212;I had way more to do for this round of revisions than I remembered.</p>
<p>No big deal, right?</p>
<p>Except it was.</p>
<p>I'd set expectations so high that anything less than getting through all 18 chapters was going to feel like I came up short. Never mind that 18 chapters represented half of the book's total volume. Never mind that I did end up actually getting five chapters revised. Never mind that in the course of those revisions, I added a number of quality scenes to fill in gaps that desperately needed filling.</p>
<p>Despite all of that progress, it still felt like failure.</p>
<p>Naturally, I got crabby. A three dollar bottle of wine and some cuddles with the cats later, the funk still lingered. All the same, I went to bed on Saturday night sure I'd wake up tomorrow and be ready to take on every last one of the chapters I had left.</p>
<p>But when I woke up, I <em>wasn't </em>ready for that. Not at all.</p>
<p>What I was ready for, however, was one chapter. One. I knew if I started with one paragraph, one page, one scene of revisions, I might be able to press on from there.</p>
<p>When I finished my first chapter, I felt good. Great. Grand. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Of course that meant I still had more than a dozen to go if I was going to achieve the goal I'd set for myself going into the weekend. So what did I do?</p>
<p>Nothing. I didn't do a ding-dang thing. Why?</p>
<p>Because what I'd done was already good enough. I was good enough. Both my work and I had been good enough all along; I'd just blinded myself by clinging to a goal I created, a goal that was destined to set me up for failure.</p>
<p>Earlier I mentioned I thought I'd have no problem doing all the things, and that, in the end, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Upon further reflection, though, I don't think that's the case. I <em>did </em>do all the things. I did all the things I could manage, all the things I was capable of while taking my own happiness into account.</p>
<p>Could I be working on revisions right now instead of writing this post? Could I have been working on them all afternoon instead of watching the Bucks, playing Wii baseball, and reading or napping on the couch? Yeah.</p>
<p>But I didn't, and I'm better for it.</p>
<p>That's a mentality I know I need to get better about embracing. I can't tie my value to my productivity, and I'd encourage you to avoid falling into that trap yourself.</p>
<p>So should you set goals? I encourage you to.</p>
<p>Should they be challenging? The best ones are.</p>
<p>Should failure to achieve them leave you so frustrated you lose track of all the good you've done or the world beyond your work? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>So when setting goals, remember the following. Make them challenging but achievable. Make them quantifiable if you can. Make them about things within your control.</p>
<p>But don't let <em>them </em>control <em>you. </em></p>
