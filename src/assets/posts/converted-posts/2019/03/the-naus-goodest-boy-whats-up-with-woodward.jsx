<p>Since the earliest of reviews for <em>Imminent Dawn </em>have come in, much ado has been made about the fate of the North American Union's best, most charming, wonderful boy Woodward.</p>
<p>Where does he wind up when all is said and done? Why would the author leave us hanging like this? What's Woodward's true status when <em>Imminent Dawn</em> ends, and what is wrong with you, r. r. campbell?!</p>
<p>Folks, I get it. No one wants anything bad to happen to a doggo who was nothing but a loyal friend to a seemingly polarizing perspective character. Regardless of where you fall on the <em>Meredith is my favorite </em>or <em>Meredith is the worst </em>spectrum, however, I want to leave readers of the EMPATHY series with the following.</p>
<p>Characters are going to come and go. Some will meet untimely fates, and others will achieve all they set out to achieve before they fade away. Still others will be with us for the long haul, and many more for not so quite as long.</p>
<p>For those who get as much page time as Woodward, though, rest assured that <strong><em>you will know when you have seen them for the last time</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Keep reading.</p>
