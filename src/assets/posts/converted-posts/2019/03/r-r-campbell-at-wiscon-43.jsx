    <p>This Memorial Day weekend, join me at WisCon, Wisconsin's annual celebration of all things science fiction and fantasy!</p>
<p>May 24th through 27th, I'll be tabling for the EMPATHY series with copies of both <em>Imminent Dawn </em>and <em>Mourning Dove </em>available. And who knows? You might even find me doing a reading or two or giving those who swing by the table a sneak peek at what they can expect from book three in the series, <em>Event Horizon</em>!</p>
<p>To register for WisCon, you can <a href="http://wiscon.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learn more on their website here</a>.</p>
