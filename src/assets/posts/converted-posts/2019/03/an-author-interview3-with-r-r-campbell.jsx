    <p><em>Imminent Dawn </em>and I got a nice feature over on the blog of author Nicki J Markus! This series of posts on her site asks authors to name three of their favorites, bits of advice, or things they're looking forward to in the coming year.</p>
<p>Want to know how I answered those questions for the EMPATHY universe and <em>Imminent Dawn </em>in particular? <a href="http://www.nickijmarkus.com/2019/03/author-interview3-r-r-campbell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can check out the full post here.</a></p>
