    <p>As writers, it can be difficult to know which editor will be the best fit for our work, let alone whether any given editor will be worth what they charge.</p>
<p>That's why I've decided to make it even easier to decide whether I'm the right editor for you.</p>
<p><strong>I'm now offering free ten-page critiques to writers who might be interested in hiring me as an editor. </strong></p>
<p>How does it work, you ask?</p>
<p>It's simple, really. You contact me through <a href="https://ryanrcampbell.com/lets-do-this/" rel="noopener">my website's editing contact page</a>. Then we discuss by email what you're looking for in an editor, and I provide a sample edit on your manuscript's first ten pages accordingly.</p>
<p>If you think we're a good fit after checking out the sample edits, we can talk about possible next steps! I'm thrilled to offer this new service, so please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>To learn more about my editing services, <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/editing-services">please visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest in my work as a writing coach. Write on and write well.</p>
