    <p>I've been away from short fiction ever since “What It Is to Smell of Man” was published in 2017.</p>
<p>That changes this Friday.</p>
<p>The last two years have been marked by change, personally, professionally, and on the page. Where my fiction is concerned, my focus has been exclusively on novel-length media, apparent in the publication of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1949909387/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accounting for It All</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1949909980/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imminent Dawn</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1950412644/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mourning Dove</a></em>.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, however, there's been a shift. I've returned to writing in short bursts with different emphases and centering that which I write on more personal matters.</p>
<p>Through daily reflections posted over the course of this week, we'll explore this shift and the themes that underwrite my forthcoming short, “State Line,” the story of a widower confronting a recent loss and interstate stereotypes.</p>
<p>So stay tuned, and ready yourselves not only for “State Line,” but for my debut on <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/iamrrcampbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wattpad</a>, where this flash fiction piece will be published on Friday.</p>
<p>Write on. Write well. Be your best you.</p>
