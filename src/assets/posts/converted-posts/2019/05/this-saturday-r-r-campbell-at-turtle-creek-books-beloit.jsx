    <p>Don't forget&#8212;I'll be in <a href="https://visitbeloit.com/calendar/author-r-r-campbell-at-turtle-creek-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beloit this Saturday at Turtle Creek Books</a> to talk all things sci-fi and read from <em>Imminent Dawn </em>and <em>Mourning Dove</em>, the first two installments in my EMPATHY sci-fi saga! You can learn more below.</p>
<hr />
<p>Timed perfectly to coincide with Beloit’s first farmer’s market of the year, author r. r. campbell will be signing and reading books only a block away at Turtle Creek Bookstore on May 4th, 2019 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>r. r. will read from and have available his novels IMMINENT DAWN and MOURNING DOVE, the first two installments in his epic EMPATHY sci-fi saga.</p>
<p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author (and Beloit native!) Matt Forbeck has called IMMINENT DAWN an “incisive techno-thriller that gets more tense with every page,” and Ravenous for Reads has described it as a “<em>Black-Mirror</em>-esque sci-fi thriller.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Though <strong>I encourage you to get your copies of the books while in attendance</strong>, if you're going to be out of town or can't make it to Beloit, you can find both books online below.</p>
