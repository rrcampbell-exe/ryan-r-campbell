    <p>I'm thrilled to announce I'll now be teaching, coaching, and consulting through Stoughton Parks and Recreation! I'm really grateful for this opportunity and look forward to becoming more involved in the local arts community.</p>
<p>If you're unable to enroll in my in-person <a href="https://continuingstudies.wisc.edu/classes/plot-your-way-to-success/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Write Your Novel Now” course through the University of Wisconsin</a>, you'll still have a chance to be a part of this class (under a different name) through the Stoughton, Wisconsin Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>
<p><strong>Course Description</strong></p>
<p>Writing is always a challenge, especially when we're unsure where to start or where we'll head next. The good news? There's a map to guide you and your characters to the story you seek!</p>
<p>In these sessions, writers will shed their fear of the blank page by developing their novels from scratch, journeying from concept creation to plot modeling and scene-by-scene outlining. After completing this course, attendees will be equipped with a map to confidently lead their characters from their ordinary worlds to the treasures they so long for.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>How much will this course cost? When and where will they be held?</strong></p>
<p>The links above will have all the who, what, when, where, and how for these courses.</p>
<p><strong>Are these courses available only in person?</strong></p>
<p>For now, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Will they ever be available online?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'm actively working on launching <a href="http://www.rrcampbellwrites.com/courses">a series of online classes.</a></p>
<p><strong>When will they be available online?</strong></p>
<p>Audio and video recording and editing is extremely time-consuming, and I want to make sure the final products are of the quality you've come to expect from my podcasts, in-person courses, editing services, and books. As such, I can't provide a concrete timeline at this moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks again to the Stoughton Department of Parks and Recreation for this opportunity! I'm looking forward to offering “Mapping Your Way to Story” this winter and expanding my offerings during the spring and summer of 2020.</p>
