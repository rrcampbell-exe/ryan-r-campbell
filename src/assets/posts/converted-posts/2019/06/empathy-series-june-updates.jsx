    <p>It hasn't been especially long since I've provided an update on the series, but there have definitely been a few developments in the EMPATHY sci-fi saga, so let's explore!</p>
<h2>Audiobooks!</h2>
<p>I'm working on it, trust me.</p>
<p>After feedback from a number of people at WisCon in May, it seems there really is a decent demand for this series in audiobook format, which is great! The challenge here, unfortunately, is that audiobooks are very costly to produce, and finding the right voice actor can be tough.</p>
<p>There is something you can do to help get us closer to making EMPATHY audiobooks a reality, though!</p>
<p>Voice actors want to know they're going to get a good return on the time they invest recording, so they often turn to reviews on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1Q8C6G/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43196570-imminent-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodreads</a> to see how much traction a book has. That means both quality <em>and</em> quantity of reviews are important.</p>
<p>You likely see where this is going, but in case not&#8212;if you've read any of the books in this series, please consider leaving an honest review on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1Q8C6G/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43196570-imminent-dawn">Goodreads</a>. And note this: <strong>you don't have to have purchased a book on Amazon in order to leave a review on Amazon.</strong> It's true, I promise.</p>
<p>Despite the hype there might be behind the scenes and person-to-person, the more demonstrable hype we have online for this series, the more likely its installments are to be made into audiobooks (and sooner, too)!</p>
<p>And thank you to everyone who's already left a review. They really do help other readers find the series, which is all any writer can ask for.</p>
<h2>También disponible en español</h2>
<p>Well, not quite yet, but soon(ish)! That's right; <em>Imminent Dawn </em>is now scheduled to be translated into Spanish. As of now, the timeline for this isn't certain, but all of the dominos have been placed, and I'm hopeful the first few of them will fall starting later this year.</p>
<p>This means <em>Imminent Dawn </em>isn't likely to be available in Spanish until 2020 at the earliest, but until then it'll be exciting to imagine copies of <em>Amanecer Inminente </em>in <em>manos </em>everywhere!</p>
<h2>EMPATHY - Now Streaming Everywhere</h2>
<p>Hopefully. Eventually.</p>
<p>In the coming months, I plan on writing a possible pilot episode for an EMPATHY televised serial. I'll be studying up on screenplay formatting and will start scrawling this July if my timelines remain on target. My plan is to use a few connections I've made with some folks in the world of TV and film to see what might be done about finding representation for those rights, as I've retained those in my publishing contracts.</p>
<p>It's a dream, sure, but I figure doing the ground work here will be worthwhile. In the very least, I'll learn a thing or two about writing for TV and film, which isn't a bad thing.</p>
<h2>What about <em>Event Horizon</em>?</h2>
<p>Yes, I know. You're wondering where book three of the series fits in amid all of these new ventures and exciting announcements.</p>
<p>Well, I won't leave you high and dry here.</p>
<p><em>Event Horizon </em>is now off to my editor and a small group of beta readers, all of which is to say a readable draft of this book exists! We're definitely on target for our spring 2020 release.</p>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with how this installment turned out, though I can see how readers might view this one as another transitional book in the series. In some ways, books two through five will be the equivalent of pages one to two hundred in <em>Imminent Dawn</em> with a lot of build up and a few twists and turns along the way. The final one or two books in the series will then be where we get the final clashes, the high-stakes action, and the do-or-die moments that have been set up in the first installments of the series.</p>
<p>I think what I like most about <em>Event Horizon </em>is how much time we get to spend with Ty. He really carries this one, and I know he's become a favorite to a number of you. I'm totally with you on that; he's among my favorite characters to write (Chandra is still my first love where this series is concerned), and that makes getting his story down a really wonderful experience, even if he does have about nineteen pots too many on the stovetop in <em>Event Horizon</em>, so to speak.</p>
<h2>Where in the world is <em>Rubicon</em>?</h2>
<p>It's on my mind, I promise. I plan on taking a few months off from writing the main thrust of the series, however, in order to keep myself from getting burnt out. I'll have plenty on my plate with the above projects, and I want to make sure I don't rush through the stories of Alistair, Heather, Peter, Ren, and Gary (and others!) when it comes time to pick up where I left off with book four, <em>Rubicon</em>.</p>
<p>All good things in time, folks, or at least that's what I keep telling myself.</p>
