    <p>Recently I had the chance to talk about writing, editing, and impostor syndrome on Casual Misfit Radio with host Kyle V. Hiller, and fellow RevPit editors Carly Hayward and Editor Cassandra.</p>
<p>If you want to work with an editor but find yourself afraid of the how, when, and why to approach one, we cover all of this and more in this podcast episode. We all also open up about our own struggles with impostor syndrome and the Dunning-Kruger effect, which makes this episode a must-listen for writers at any stage of their writing journey.</p>
