    <p>On the release day of book two in the EMPATHY series, I thought I'd look back on what went into writing it and thank those of you who helped bring <em>Mourning Dove </em>into the world.</p>
<p>From the book's acknowledgements&#8212;</p>
<p class="column">It is strange to have written this book.</p>
<p class="column">After having written Imminent Dawn over the course of five years, the five months in which I drafted Mourning Dove feel as though they existed out of time. It isn’t until I think of the individuals whose support helped shape this novel that those months come back to me, complete with their feverish sunrise drafting sessions and much pacing around the apartment.</p>
<p class="column">First of all, thank you, Lacey. Your patience and encouragement as I wrote this book in the lead up to our wedding cannot be repaid. This book is better for your grace and understanding, and I know that I am, too.</p>
<p class="column">To my beta readers, M.A. Hinkle and Scott Birrenkott, your feedback was a tremendous boon in my ability to submit this manuscript confidently, and I thank you for it. The series’ cast of characters thanks you for it, too, though I’m sure they’d prefer things worked out a bit differently for them. We’ll see how it all comes together in the end; perhaps they’ll have reason for further thanks as the series progresses.</p>
<p class="column">I’m also indebted to Catherine Labelle and Tilyian Morrin, whose respective input on the novel’s use of French and details about Costa Rica helped bring those locales and cultures to life.</p>
<p class="column">And, as always, thank you to Raevyn at NineStar Press and my editor, Stacey Jo, for all you’ve done to get this book and series where it is today. Natasha Snow has again created a phenomenal cover, and I’m so looking forward to what she creates for the later installments in the series.</p>
<p class="column">Finally, I want to thank the readers of Imminent Dawn, whose excitement and engagement rejuvenate me at every turn. I’m thrilled to know you’re along for this ride.</p>
<p class="column">Let’s see where it takes us.</p>
