    <p>We've got a schedule, folks! Plan accordingly.</p>
<p>In between tabling throughout the conference, I'll be at WisCon 43 participating in a panel about writing a series, as well as leading two sessions on the craft of writing in general. The full schedule of my time at WisCon is as follows&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>Plotting Past Book One (Panel)<br />
Friday, May 24 - 4:00 p.m. - 5:15 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>The internet offers a wide array of writing advice, but a real shortage of advice on pacing, plot, and character arcs for a multi-book series. Come hear advice on managing these and other challenges of series writing from authors who have been there.</p>

<p><strong>Solidify Your Scenes with the Five Core Components of Scene Structure<br />
Saturday, May 25 - 7:00 p.m. - 8:45 p.m.</strong></p>
<p>In this session, writers will learn how to inject goal-oriented storytelling into their pages in order to keep scenes tight. After this exploration of scene at the molecular level, writers will leave this session ready to put the five core components of scene structure to work for them and perfect their pacing!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Why Are We Yelling? Conflict as Fuel for Momentum<br />
Sunday, May 26 - 10:00 a.m. - 11:45 a.m.</strong></p>
<p>A lack of conflict can be a common critique from beta readers, but what do they mean by this, exactly, and what are they really after? In this session, attendees will do a deep dive into conflict: what it is, why it's important, and how we can use it to fuel our stories. Writers will leave this workshop with a greater understanding of goal-oriented storytelling and its role as the origin of conflict along with mystery, suspense, and dramatic irony.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aside from the above, I'll be tabling at the conference near the vendors' area, and will be able to chat all things EMPATHY, science fiction, and writing! Come say hi and grab a copy of a book in the EMPATHY series while you're at it.</p>
<p>If you'd prefer to get your copies of the series' books before this Memorial Day weekend event, you can find them at the below links.</p>
