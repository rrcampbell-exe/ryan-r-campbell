<p>A few of you may remember <a href="https://accountingforitall.com/2018/12/05/and-its-off-afia-the-wisrwa-write-touch-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post from a few months ago</a>, in which I mentioned <em>Accounting for It All </em>had been admitted to the Wisconsin Romance Writers of America’s Write Touch Awards.</p>
<p>The book recently received its scores from the judges, and <em>wow!</em></p>
<p><em>Accounting for It All</em> <strong>just </strong>missed placing in the top three. Not only that, but one judge mentioned they “couldn’t put it down.”</p>
<p>On the surface, <em>Accounting for It All </em>might not have won, but this still feels very much like a win.</p>
<p>Want to get your hands on a copy of the book other reviewers have said has kept them up turning pages long into the night? You can grab your copy at any of the links below.</p>
