To do this, we'll do a deep dive into Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns. If you haven't read A Thousand Splendid Suns, there's no need to fear: I provide context along the way to make sure the content is as accessible to those who have read as it is to those who have not. After each topic, I offer sample writing exercises or prompts you can use to move forward with a re-examination of or fresh perspective on the subject matter discussed. So pop in those headphones or turn up the speakers, it's time for the very first Biblio Breakdown!",
